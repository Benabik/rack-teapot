# rack-teapot

A silly [Rack](https://rack.github.io) app/middleware that responds with [418
I'm a Teapot](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/418) to
requests for coffee.

To use:

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rackup >/dev/null &
$ curl -i -w "\n" http://localhost:9292/$(ruby -rcgi -e 'puts CGI.escape("‚òïÔ∏è")')
HTTP/1.1 418
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 4
Server: WEBrick/1.6.0 (Ruby/2.7.1/2020-03-31)
Date: Sat, 01 Aug 2020 02:42:53 GMT
Connection: Keep-Alive

üçµ
$ kill %1
```

As a standalone application, it returns 404 for any other request.  Used as
middleware, it passes non-coffee requests to the next application.

To integrate with an existing application, add this to your `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'rack-teapot', git: 'https://github.com/benabik/rack-teapot'
```

For a Rack application add `use RackTeapot` to your `config.ru`.  For a
[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) application, add `config.middleware.use
RackTeapot` to your `config/application.rb`.

## TODO

* Add railtie to automagically add middleware.
* Add text to status message (at first glance, this doesn't seem possible with pure Rack)
* Tests
